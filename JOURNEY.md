The Journey
===========

What happened, when, and most importantly, why! _(maybe)_

### June 13th, 2018.
Today is the first day working on this application. So far I've refreshed myself on Flask and KnockoutJS, and put together a very basic outline _which will likely change_. Right now very basic "features" can be added on the main single page of this applications, previous entries are shown as Bootstrap card elements below the form.

### June 14th, 2018.
Things needed more separation so everything was extrapolated a bit. Templates now have a `layout.html` file they extend, the main contents of the app are in `app` and we started using SQLAlchemy. Additionally, a "Clients" page and model was added. In order to further control the JSON the API returns marshmallow_sqlalchemy was used.

### June 17th, 2018.
Worked on prioritizing list function. Didn't realize Borders closed at 7pm on Sunday. Didn't have as much time here as I had hoped.

### June 18th, 2018.
Was able to setup adding/re-prioritizing and removing/re-prioritizing. Removing still needs a bit of work but otherwise, when adding an Feature Request it will re-order the UI in real-time.
